      <h2>Who is Ratan Tata?</h2>
      <p>
        Ratan Naval Tata is more than a businessman. He is a visionary, a philanthropist, and one of the most respected leaders India has ever seen. Born on December 28, 1937, in Mumbai, he is the former Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group — one of the biggest and oldest conglomerates in India. But beyond numbers and boardrooms, Ratan Tata represents ethics, humility, and courage.

He taught us that it’s possible to build billion-dollar empires without losing kindness. He showed that true leadership is about lifting others up, staying grounded, and never backing down from doing what is right.
